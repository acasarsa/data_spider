# InfoScraper

This is a scraping project I'm working on, there will be a few files in here. Currently working on making use of fantasy football data. 

## Installation

Execute 

    $ bundle install

## Usage

Currently the zillow scraper does not work due to their anti-scrapping measures
For fantasypros you can clone this repo down, bundle install, run it and pull out the rankings into a json file.
